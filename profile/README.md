> *“It runs. We don’t know why. But it runs.”*

Welcome to **DumpsterFireLabs**, dedicated to **vibecoding old games**, recreating retro classics, and building spiritual successors to the abandonware we grew up with.  
We don’t take ourselves too seriously — but we *do* love the art of making janky little games work again.

Whether it’s a half-broken remake of a 90s title, a modern reimagining of a shareware gem, or a questionable prototype built at 2AM, this is where it lives.

## 🎮 What We Do

### ✔ Retro Recreation Projects
We recreate or reimagine classic games with modern tools — Godot, custom code, and sometimes pure spite.

### ✔ Spiritual Successors
When we can’t recreate something directly, we build legally-distinct-but-nostalgically-identical versions.

### ✔ AI-Boosted Restoration
We use AI to:
- make sketchy code that is questionably implemented
- analyze/decompile weird old assets  
- upscale sprites  
- generate placeholder art  
- fill in missing sound effects  
- revive “lost” mechanics  

### ✔ LAN-Friendly Chaos
Whenever possible, we sneak in:
- LAN play  
- co-op  
- split-screen madness  
- jank test modes

## 🔥 Our Philosophy

### 1. **Vibes > Perfection**
If it’s fun, it’s done.

### 2. **Jank is a Feature**
If it breaks in a funny way, that’s staying in the final release.

### 3. **Open Source Wins**
Every project here is fully open source, remixable, forkable, and built in public.

### 4. **Preserve the Feel, Not the Files**
We don’t clone copyrighted code — we recreate the *experience*.

### 5. **Community First**
If you want to help, contribute, vibe, or just lurk and watch the madness:

## 🧯 Disclaimer

DumpsterFireLabs is not affiliated with the creators of the original games we love.  
We build **homages, reimaginations, and spiritual successors** — not commercial clones or copyrighted reproductions.

We’re here to celebrate the past, not infringe on it.

If you're expecting coding perfection, novel algorithms, or peak professionalism, this probably isn't what you're looking for.
